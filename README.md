# Story Graph

StoryGraph is a speech to image application. It's main use case is for bed time
story telling: imagine telling a story to someone and having an app render
a number of images for each phrase you speak.

## Technical details

We use Watson Speech API for speech to text transformation. After that
we feed each phrase into Google's Syntax Net to adnotate it with POS. Then we
apply some a model to summarize the phrase to a number of search terms that we
use to search images using bing image search.
